# The Mario Kart Image Classifier: A Race to Accuracy

Author: Oanh Doan

This project served as the final undertaking for my Introduction to Machine Learning course, a crucial component of my MS in Analytics program at Georgia Tech. It revolved around developing image classification models for the beloved characters from Mario Kart, seamlessly marrying my passion for the game with the intricacies of machine learning and computer vision.

## Overview
Mario Kart is a wildly popular racing game on Nintendo Switch, featuring a diverse cast of $42$ characters, $8046$ vehicle combinations, and $48$ racing circuits, each with unique attributes. With such a wide array of character and vehicle design options, the game offers endless possibilities that are visually captivating. The objective of this project is to develop image classification models for Mario Kart characters, which will be riding different vehicles in distinctive background settings. The project will evaluate and compare the performance of k-nearest neighbor classifier - a representative of traditional machine learning methods, and that of a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, namely Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
